# lessOrGreat
A random number guesser in c++

Just a random extremely small side project

## Objective
You will be asked to enter a max range of numbers. Then you
will have to guess the number from range 0 - the range you entered.
The program will help you to guess the number by giving hints on how
close the number is to the actual number.

## Building

```
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build/
./build/lessOrGreat
```
